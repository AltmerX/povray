Changes between POV-Ray 3.7.0 and UberPOV 1.37.0.0
--------------------------------------------------

Change 5956 on 2013/07/26 by clipka@cli-private

    updated change.txt

Change 5955 on 2013/07/26 by clipka@cli-private

    overhauled install guides and licensing stuff, and renamed some
    distribution files that still carried "povray" in their name

Change 5954 on 2013/07/23 by clipka@cli-private

    added two more sample scenes

Change 5953 on 2013/07/23 by clipka@cli-private

    implemented blurred reflections, and changed interaction of multiple
    oversampling features along a ray's path so that the second (and any
    subsequent) oversampling feature will now dynamically adjust the number
    of rays shot rather than shooting just a single ray; also applied a
    few minor code changes.

    Blurred reflections are enabled by adding a "roughness NUMBER" parameter
    to the reflection block, with values corresponding to the highlights
    roughness parameter. The number of oversampling rays is determined
    automatically depending on the roughness. This language extension is
    named "upov-reflection-roughness", and its current implementation is
    version 0.9.

Change 5952 on 2013/07/23 by clipka@cli-private

    fixed a bug in radiosity.cpp concerning interaction between radiosity
    and other oversampling features

Change 5951 on 2013/07/23 by clipka@cli-private

    Modified area lights and subsurface light transport to use less samples
    if another oversampling element is already involved in the ray's path
    (currently this applies to anti-aliasing mode 3, focal blur, SSLT,
    and radiosity sample rays). Area lights will now always use jitter in
    such cases.

Change 5949 on 2013/07/22 by clipka@cli-private

    added license notice to glare desaturation sample scene

Change 5948 on 2013/07/22 by clipka@cli-private

    Added anti-aliasing mode 3, which uses a stochastic metric of each
    pixel and its immediate neighborhood to determine how many samples
    to take; samples are distributed evenly within each pixel using
    a sub-random sequence. An absolute maximum number of samples is
    specified by the +Rn (Antialias_Depth=n) parameter, using the formula
    N=2^(n*2). Antialias_Threshold=n.n (+An.n) specifies a stochastic
    parameter called variance (essentially how much error in the color of each
    pixel you are willing to accept), while the new Antialias_Confidence=n.n
    (+ACn.n) parameter specifies another stochastic parameter called
    confidence (essentially how sure you want to be that the computed color
    of any given pixel is within the error margin specified by the variance).
    When anti-aliasing mode 3 is selected, focal blur oversampling
    parameters (blur_samples, confidence and variance) will be entirely
    ignored; the focal blur algorithm will instead perform only jittering
    of individual rays, while leaving the oversampling process entirely to
    the anti-aliasing algorithm.

Change 5947 on 2013/07/22 by clipka@cli-private

    integrate from POV-Ray 3.7 rev. #5946

Change 5945 on 2013/07/22 by clipka@cli-private

    integrate from POV-Ray 3.7 rev. #5940

Change 5944 on 2013/07/22 by clipka@cli-private

    updated a bunch of file headers

Change 5942 on 2013/07/22 by clipka@cli-private

    added changes.txt and revision.txt

Change 5941 on 2013/07/22 by clipka@cli-private

    fixed DISTRIBUTION_MESSAGE_2 sometimes being redefined; also fixed
    perforce filetype of branch.h

Change 5939 on 2013/07/20 by clipka@cli-private-ux

    fixed broken unix build

Change 5938 on 2013/07/20 by clipka@cli-private-ux

    Add ~/unix/NEWS and ~/unix/ChangeLog back in again, as I found that
    automake demands their presence; also fixed a bug in prebuild.sh

Change 5935 on 2013/07/20 by clipka@cli-private

    added sample scene for glare desaturation feature

Change 5934 on 2013/07/20 by clipka@cli-private

    updating unix files to reflect branching
    (still needs testing)

Change 5933 on 2013/07/20 by clipka@cli-private

    Merging from POV-Ray 3.7 rev. 5922 using clipka-upov (pulling in some
    distribution files from main branch) - some files had refused the
    previous attempt

Change 5931 on 2013/07/19 by clipka@cli-private

    Merging from POV-Ray 3.7 rev. 5922 using clipka-upov (pulling in some
    distribution files from main branch)

Change 5927 on 2013/07/19 by clipka@cli-private

    Stripped codemax project from the VS 2010 solution

Change 5926 on 2013/07/19 by clipka@cli-private

    added a generic syntax to check for supported language extensions
    (and the implemented versions thereof) across arbitrary branches:
    The "#patch STRING FLOAT;" directive forces a parse error if the
    specified patch is not supported at the given version number, and a
    parse warning if the major versions do not match; the "patch(STRING)"
    function returns the implemented version of the specified patch as a
    FLOAT. If the STRING is omitted, both language constructs apply to the
    version of this feature itself (0.99 at present).
    I suggest that branches of POV-Ray adopting this feature should accept
    the version statement syntax "#version unofficial patch FLOAT;", where
    FLOAT is the official POV-Ray version the branch is based on, rather
    than the version of the branch itself, and that the "version" variable
    should also return the official POV-Ray version the branch is based on.

Change 5925 on 2013/07/19 by clipka@cli-private

    change console executable names

Change 5924 on 2013/07/18 by clipka@cli-private

    fix codemax.h, which for mysterious reasons got broken

Change 5923 on 2013/07/18 by clipka@cli-private

    integrate from POV-Ray 3.7 rev. #5922

Change 5921 on 2013/07/18 by clipka@cli-private

    implement glare desaturation feature:
    If the output file does not support high dynamic range and there are
    colors in the image with some - but not all - components overexposed,
    such colors can now be desaturated in favor of preserving the brightness;
    the +GLDn or Glare_Desaturation=n parameter controls the strength of
    this effect: 0.0 = off (default), 1.0 = brightness is preserved at all
    cost. If the output file does support high dynamic range, the effect
    is still applied to the preview window.

Change 5920 on 2013/07/18 by clipka@cli-private

    updated manifest

Change 5919 on 2013/07/18 by clipka@cli-private

    replaced the name "POV-Ray" in plenty of places within the code,
    introducing a framework that should help developers of other branches
    as well

Change 5918 on 2013/07/18 by clipka@cli-private

    replaced some resources and changed the executable name

Change 5917 on 2013/07/18 by clipka@cli-private

    trimming down the build stuff; for now, this branch will not have an
    installer, nor will it submit crash dumps anywhere, and the only build
    environment supported will be Visual Studio 2010

Change 5916 on 2013/07/17 by clipka@cli-private

    Branching from POV-Ray 3.7 rev. #5915 using clipka-upov
