Commit 61c0990 on 2014-07-26 by Christoph Lipka

    Modified macro system to specify version, copyright and build information.

    Changed distribution of macros among the files backend/povray.h and base/branch.h; added
    another file base/build.h specifically for stuff pertaining to an individual build, e.g.
    whether it's official, who compiled it, etc.

Commit 91a2ad7 on 2014-07-25 by Christoph Lipka

    Added a sample scene for the "blink" feature.

Commit 6003aa7 on 2014-07-25 by Christoph Lipka

    Initial preparations for a stand-alone build of UberPOV.

    The stand-alone build is supposed to come with its own installer, and run without, or
    independent of, any existing official POV-Ray installation. This commit includes the following
    changes in preparation to this end:

      - Reviewed the `distribution` directory tree, removing a few files and updating others; most
        of this tree is now considered official part of UberPOV, with the exception of the help
        file and the icons.
      - Reviewed and updated `windows/setup.nsi`, which is now considered official part of UberPOV
        as well.
      - Updated Windows-specific code to use an alternate registry key and directory names to live
        nicely alongside with POV-Ray without mutual interference. This code can be activated via
        the `STANDALONE_BUILD` precompiler define.
      - The stand-alone variant will identify itself via a ".stalone" suffix after the version
        number.
      - Slightly modified original "piggyback" variant to more clearly identify itself in the
        `POV-Ray/CurrentVersion/Windows/VersionNo64` registry key.

Commit 2c1b429 on 2014-07-24 by Christoph Lipka

    Merge branch 'release/v1.37.0.0-beta.6'

Commit fede6a2 on 2014-07-24 by Christoph Lipka

    preparing v1.37.0.0-beta.6

Commit 21cc3c6 on 2014-07-24 by Christoph Lipka

    Add support for stochastic diffuse computations.

    Specifying `no_cache` in the global radiosity block will disable caching of radiosity samples,
    and use a more random algorithm to generate secondary ray directions, effectively using the
    radiosity code for straightforward stochastic computation of diffuse illumination.

Commit d197937 on 2014-07-23 by Christoph Lipka

    Merge branch 'povray/master' into develop

Commit 54b283a on 2014-07-23 by Christoph Lipka

    Improved finish features for more realism:

      - Radiosity support for brilliance is now available; to activate it, specify `brilliance on`
        in the global radiosity settings.
      - The brilliance effect can now be applied not only to incoming light, but also to outgoing
        light; to activate this, specify a second FLOAT value
        after the `brilliance` keyword. For maximum realism, both parameters should be set to the
        same value.
      - Fresnel angle-dependent attenuation can now also be enabled for highlights and the diffuse
        component, by specifying `fresnel on` directly in the finish block.
        (Note that you will still need to enable fresnel attenuation for reflections separately;
        also note that where reflection and highlights increase at shallow angles,
        the diffuse component decreases accordingly.) For a perfect match between reflection and
        highlights use the `albedo` keyword for the highlight with the same
        value as the reflection maximum; the reflection minimum should be set to zero.

    Yet more fixes for GitHub issue #29.

Commit f42a95b on 2014-06-30 by Christoph Lipka

    More fixes for GitHub issue #29.

    As the inclusion of <math.h> instead of <cmath> appears to be the source of one of the compile
    errors, I've also replaced other C standard header file includes with the respective C++
    counterparts along the way throughout the project (except the Windows specific code for now).

Commit f68065b on 2014-06-29 by Christoph Lipka

Commit eee8ece on 2014-06-25 by Christoph Lipka

    More colour related refactoring.

    Render engine is now almost entirely unaware of the colour model used (currently still RGB, but
    a spectral model might be a future option).
    Also "unbundled" colour and filter/transmit information in many places, in preparation for
    full-colour transparency computations.

Commit caee861 on 2014-06-24 by Christoph Lipka

    Merge branch 'povray/refactor' into develop

Commit 0ea2da4 on 2014-06-23 by Christoph Lipka

    More colour data type refactoring.

    Now using different dedicated colour data types for:
    - parsing (legacy RGBFT format)
    - front-end result image processing (RGBT format; the front-end never actually used the filter
      channel)
    - render engine colour math (currently RGBFT format; intended to be later replaced with RGB
      colour + RGB transmit)

Commit eca922a on 2014-06-19 by Christoph Lipka

    Replaced `SMALL_COLOUR` legacy type with new type `PhotonColour` based on new class template
    `GenericRGBEColour`; also employing this new type in Radiance HDR image file reading & writing.

    corresponds to Perforce change 6164.

Commit 4f39fd0 on 2013-12-16 by Christoph Lipka

    header file cleanup: Weeded out frame.h, removing obsolete stuff and moving some definitions
    out to other headers; also weeded out a few other header files, moving some stuff to the
    corresponding .cpp files or to different header files.

    corresponds to Perforce change 6163.

    introduced new class BasicRay as lightweight alternative to (and base class for) class Ray, to

    portion of photons code; also replaced these types in the Blob class except where dictated by
    the ObjectBase interface;
    gave old BBOX data type a facelift along the way, throwing out the union and separating it into
    two separate new types (BoundingBox and MinMaxBoundingBox).

Commit e7b7ed3 on 2014-05-28 by Christoph Lipka

    Improved render performance in scenes with many distance-based fading lights, by cutting off
    fading lights entirely at a certain distance.
    The cutoff distance is computed automatically from light source parameters and global
    adc_bailout, but can be overridden individually by the new max_distance parameter in the
    light_source block.

    Add `Create_Continue_Trace_Log` ini setting and `-CC` command line option.

    Specifying `Create_Continue_Trace_Log=no` or `-CC` will suppress the creation of the
    `.pov-state` file. Note that while this may save space and even speed up simple renders, if you
    abort the render you will be unable to continue it later using the `Continue_Trace=yes` or `+C`
    options.

    Fixing fs#317

Commit d60416f on 2013-12-06 by Christoph Lipka (c-lipka)

    Merge pull request #14 from yoe/master

    Files shipping with automake are now automatically taken from there, using the --add-missing
    parameter.
    Fixes issue #6. Thanks to Wouter "yoe" Verhelst.

Commit 9e7e624 on 2013-12-06 by Wouter Verhelst

    Make sure Makefile.in gets generated properly

    config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, etc, are all scripts that ship with
    automake, and which will be updated with a new automake version; it's
    generally a bad idea to use one of these scripts from a different
    automake version.

    Moreover, recent versions of automake also contain and require a
    "compile" script, which isn't in this directory.

    Instead, pass the "--add-missing" parameter to automake, which will copy
    the required files to the expected location. This will make automake
    work, regardless of the version, and will avoid any issues due to the
    used scripts not matching the used automake version.

Commit 227c801 on 2013-12-05 by Christoph Lipka (c-lipka)

    Merge pull request #13 from yoe/master

    Unix build process now automatically detects whether -lboost_thread requires -lboost_system to
    work. (Thanks to Wouter "yoe" Verhelst for the fix.)

Commit cba5bc5 on 2013-12-06 by Wouter Verhelst

    Account for changes in boost dependencies

    Since <boost/thread/thread.hpp> includes some headers which will already
    call a boost_system function, recent versions of boost require
    -lboost_system before -lboost_thread will work, resulting in a failure
    of this test if not accounted for.

    Make it try without -lboost_system first, but try again with it added to
    $LIBS if that fails.
